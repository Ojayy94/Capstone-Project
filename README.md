# Capstone-Project
This is My Altschool Africa Capstone Project, August 2024
<br />
This project entails two aspects (i.e, 2 files)
<br />
<br />
1. Capstone Project: Analyzing Sample Databases with Python or Power BI [Chinook](https://github.com/Ojayy94/Capstone-Project/blob/main/chinook(python%20script).pbix)


   <br />
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
- In this capstone project, I was tasked to analyze one of three sample databases (Chinook, Sakila, or Northwindâ€”using either Python or Power BI.)
- The objective is to gain insights from the data and present findings through visualizations and reports.
- For the purpose of this project task, I chose Chinook.db

<br />
    
	# OBJECTIVES
      
Data Exploration: Understand the structure and content of the chosen database.

Data Analysis: Perform specific analyses to derive insights from the data.

Visualization: Create visual reports to present findings.

Presentation: Compile findings into a comprehensive report or dashboard.



<br />
2. Additional database / dataset to form another task to work on. [Sales](https://github.com/Ojayy94/Capstone-Project/blob/main/Sales_v2.pbix)



   	# OBJECTIVES
   
   
Sourcing: Tasked to individually sought out for a database of my choice

Preparation: Analyse and make explorative analysis on the report and generate impactful insights

Presentation: Prepare an adequate report on you findings to stakeholders.



**TASKS CARRIED OUT - CHINOOK**


1. Identified the type of database to work with. The file properties indicates that it is a database file which ordinarily won't be loaded to Power BI directly

2. Researched on the seamless way to safely connect a database file to Power BI

3. Wrote a python script (As a data source) which ensures a seamless connection with all constraints and data types intact

4. Updated the model view of the data

5. Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning using Power Query

6. Identified with the appropriate visuals the following which are but not limited to;

   	a. Top-Selling Artists: Identify artists with the highest sales and analyze their sales trends over time.

   	b. Customer Purchase Patterns: Segment customers based on purchase behavior and identify key characteristics of high-value customers.

   	c. Genre Popularity: Determine the most popular music genres and analyze the change in genre popularity over different time periods.

   	d. Sales Over Time: Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends, including seasonal effects and significant sales events.

   	e. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate the lifetime value of customers based on their purchase history and provide recommendations for improving customer retention.

   	f. Market Basket Analysis: Perform association rule mining to find common combinations of tracks or albums purchased together.

8. Prepared a concise presentation detailing the insights garnered from the analysis carried out. Details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVuKAm-d5sUYn-IybbB4wowRM300COwgVeef5nrmdhc/edit)
